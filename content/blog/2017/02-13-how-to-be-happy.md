Few words and videos about happiness, hugs, improvisation and dance.

## Is there a way how to be happy?

There was a question on Quora: [Why do we need to hug and to be hugged?](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-we-need-to-hug-and-to-be-hugged)

In short: we need at least 8 hugs a day in order to:

- to be happy (by boosting oxytocin levels)
- to feel good (it lowers your blood pressure, especially helpful if youâ€™re feeling anxious)
- to be healthier (hugs strengthen the immune system)
- to have less stress and sleep better (it lowers cortisol)

## How to be hugged?

Probably, we become more hugs when we are young: from our parents and grandparents.

There are many other ways to get it for adults as well, the most obvious:

- to have a life partner
- to have a kid
- to have a pet
- to hug a friend

And there are also other ways, which I want to talk about today:

- Free Hugs
- Contact Improvisation, Contango
- Kizomba
