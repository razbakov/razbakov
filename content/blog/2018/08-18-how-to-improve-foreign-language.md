## Dream

Visualize, dream, draw and write down your intention to learn the language. Set a perfect clear goal what and how exactly you want to archive it and why do you need it. Use [yearcompass](http://yearcompass.com/) to set a year goal. Don’t push yourself hard and let it go. Once you are ready to start you will feel it.

## Plan

Write down a [SMART goal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria) and breakdown to the project with a list of activities with measurable items.

During a year use declaration technique to set all your long-, mid-, short term goals (2 of each one). Stay focused on relevant thing throughout the time period. Don’t over stress yourself.

Join any online challenge and language marathon. Join [TheGame](/the-game) to compete with yourself and get inspired by likeminded people.

## Action

Once language goal appears in your horizon stick to it and do some activities every day without interruptions. Block some specific time in your day schedule. At least 5 mins a day. Better switch activities not to get bored and find something which passes better to your mood. Find a list of different activities below.

## Routines with foreign texts and words

Any language is not about words and rules. It is about culture and history of people who speaks and develops this language.

Every time you work with a foreign text do the following:
- read it
- hear it
- say it
- mark interesting words combination
- translate it
- research the history of the saying and meaning behind it
- add to your vocabulary
- remember it
- use it in your conversations
